  Data Model
    LFRic core infrastructure which provides the framework for working with data objects supporting LFRic ScienceModel(s).

  Global Mesh
    An object describing a 2D-mesh which encompasses the entirety of an LFRic application Model Domain.

  InterMesh Map
    Mapping between 2D-mesh cell IDs from source-to-target meshes. The mapping lists the cell IDs (local to the target mesh) that geographically overlap a given cell id in the source mesh (ID local to the source mesh).

  LFRic application
    A program that uses the LFRic infrastructure.

  Local Mesh
    An object describing a 2D-mesh which encompasses a sub-section (partition) of a Global Mesh. The Local Mesh object contains related mesh information similar to that of a Global Mesh. In addition, it also stores partition information unique to its intended process rank.

  Mesh
    An object describing a 3D-mesh which encompasses a sub-section (partition) of the Global Mesh. A mesh object is derived from the corresponding Local Mesh object for a given process rank and an extrusion object configured by an LFRic application.

  Model Domain
    The geographical domain extents to which an LFRic application is configured, *e.g.* GCM, LAM.

  Modeldb
    An object that encapsulates all the data required to describe both the scientific and technical state of a model.

  Science Model
     A library of code that simulates a particular science process, *e.g.* a radiation or land surface model. **Note:** An LFRic application may be written to access any number of Science Models.
