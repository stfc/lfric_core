.. _section field:

LFRic fields
------------

This section provides an overview of the different variations of
fields and how they should be initialised and used in an application.

An LFRic field holds data over the horizontal domain of a mesh. Its
design supports the LFRic separation of concerns by preventing direct
access to the data. Model manipulation of data should only be done by
passing the field to a kernel or PSyclone built-in.

While the type of an LFRic field definds the type (real or integer)
and kind (32-bit or 64-bit) of data, all other aspects of the data
depend on the choice of :ref:`function space <section function space>`
used to initialise the field, including the layout of data points on
each 3-dimensional cell.

Initialising new fields
=======================

To create a field, first construct a :ref:`function space <section
function space>` and a 3-dimensional mesh (note that a 3D mesh with a
single level may be referred to in the code as a 2-dimensional
mesh). The code for creating a new field based on an existing mesh
``mesh_id`` and function space ``W2`` is as follows. In this and other
examples, ``field_type`` can refer either to a 64-bit or a 32-bit
field depending on compile-time choices.

.. code-block:: fortran

   type(function_space_type), pointer :: vector_space
   type(field_type)                   :: wind_field

   ! Get a reference to a lowest order W2 function space
   vector_space => function_space_collection%get_fs(mesh_id, 0, W2)

   ! Create a field to hold wind data
   call wind_field%initialise(vector_space, name = "wind")

The ``name`` argument is optional, and not required for fields that
are created and used for temporary purposes. Names would be required
where fields need to be recognised by other parts of the
infrastructure such as when they are added to :ref:`field collections
<section field collection>`.

Once created, a field can be passed to a call to an ``invoke`` for
processing by a kernel or a PSyclone built-in.

A field can be initialised by constructing it from another field as
follows.

.. code-block:: fortran

   call wind_field%copy_field_properties(new_field, name = "wind_copy")

This call initialises the new field with the same mesh and function
space as ``wind_field``, but it does not copy the ``wind_field``
data. If no name argument is supplied, the new field will be unnamed
rather than adopting the name of the original field.

.. warning::

   There is an LFRic function called ``copy_field_serial`` which
   copies the field properties `and` the field data. However, as the
   name suggests, any such copy would be done serially and would not
   take advantage of any shared memory parallelism. Therefore, use of
   ``copy_field_serial`` is not advised. If the data needs to be
   copied, then use the ``setval_x`` `built-in
   <https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dynamo0p3.html#setting-to-a-value>`_
   after the field is initialised. Initialising new fields with
   ``setval_x`` allows PSyclone to optimise the copy.

   .. code-block:: fortran

      call wind_field%copy_field_properties(new_field, name = "wind_copy")
      call invoke( setval_x(new_field, wind_field) )

The function space and mesh used to initialise a field have a
particular halo depth. By default, a field is initialised with the
same halo depth. Optionally, a smaller halo depth can be requested:

.. code-block:: fortran

   ! Create a field to hold wind data
   call wind_field%initialise(vector_space, name = "wind", halo_depth = 1)

The function will fail if the requested halo depth is larger than the
function space halo.

Initialisation of field data
============================

It should be assumed that field data is not initialised to any
particular value when a field is initialised. However, if an
application is compiled with options that apply numerical checking of
results (checking for ``NaN`` values or invalid real numbers) the
field data will be initialised to IEEE signalling ``NaN`` values.

Testing applications with numerical checking compile options is
strongly recommended as inadequate initialisation of data has
intermittent, compiler-dependent and platform-dependent effects. For
example, sometimes uninitialised fields may by default be set to zero,
whereas in others they may be set to invalid numbers.

.. warning::

   It should be noted that current versions of the Gnu compiler (up to
   the current latest version 14) incorrectly assign "quiet" ``NaN``
   values which means that this recommended method of testing is
   inadequate: unlike signalling ``NaN`` values, quiet ``NaN`` values
   do not cause floating point exceptions when operated on.

   The method for initialising fields to ``NaN`` is worth summarising
   so that the behaviour of other compilers can be tested for correct
   behaviour once they start being used.

   When a field is initialised, the code runs the following IEEE
   procedure that returns ``.true.`` if numerical checking compile
   options are applied:

   .. code-block:: fortran

      call ieee_get_halting_mode(IEEE_INVALID, halt_mode)

   If ``.true.``, the following value is assigned to real fields:

   .. code-block:: fortran

      signalling_value = ieee_value(type_variable, IEEE_SIGNALING_NAN)

   As stated above, the Gnu version of the ``ieee_value`` routine
   incorrectly returns the value relating to ``IEEE_QUIET_NAN``.

Note that for 32-bit integer fields, the signalling value is set to a
negative ``huge`` 32-bit value: there is no such thing as an integer
``NaN`` value, so setting an unrealistic value that might cause
failures is the best that can be done.

The field_proxy object
----------------------

The data held in a field is private, meaning it cannot be accessed
using field methods. Clearly, the data does need to be accessed
somewhere in the code, and the field proxy provides the methods for
doing so. The field proxy object must be used with care to maintain
the integrity of the application's data.

Keeping the data private within the field is a way of enforcing the
:ref:`PSyKAl design<section concepts>` that underpins key LFRic
applications. The application needs to monitor the status of halos:
whether or not they are "dirty": out of date with the corresponding
owned data points on the neighbouring ranks. PSyclone generates code
that ensures the halo state remains consistent. If additional code is
modifying data without PSyclone's knowledge, the data will become
inconsistent.

The field proxy object may be used by application writers in the
following limited circumstances:

 #. For writing PSyKAl-lite code. PSyKAl-lite code represents
    hand-written PSy layer code where PSyclone does not support your
    requirement. The PSy layer accesses field information using the
    field proxy so it can be passed to kernels. Ideally, PSykal-lite
    code should be written in a style that, plausibly, PSyclone
    `could` generate if it were extended to support the new
    requirement.
 #. For writing an :ref:`external field <section external field>`
    interface to copy data between the LFRic application and another
    application.
 #. For debugging purposes, or within unit or integration tests.

If the field proxy is to be used, a good understanding of the
:ref:`distributed memory design <section distributed memory>` is
required so that code maintains the integrity of the data and its
halos. For example, if the data is updated in such a way that the
halos may be inconsistent with data on neighbouring partitions, then
either a halo swap needs to be performed or the halos needs to be
marked as dirty.

Data can be accessed using the proxy as follows:

.. code-block:: fortran

   real(r_def), pointer :: wind_field_data(:)
   type(field_proxy_type) :: wind_field_proxy

   wind_field_proxy = wind_field%get_proxy()
   wind_field_data => wind_field_proxy%data

.. _section mixed precision field:

Mixed precision fields
======================

The ``field_type`` object referenced in a lot of code examples found
in the documentation is either a 32-bit or a 64-bit field. The choice
of precision is made at build-time: the default is 64-bit, but 32-bit
can be chosen by setting compile def ``RDEF_PRECISION`` to 32. See the
``field_mod`` module for how the ``field_type``, and the matching
``field_proxy_type``, precision are defined. Key parts are shown here:

.. code-block fortran

   module field_mod

   #if (RDEF_PRECISION == 32)
   use field_real32_mod, only: field_type         => field_real32_type, &
                               field_proxy_type   => field_real32_proxy_type
   #else
   use field_real64_mod, only: field_type         => field_real64_type, &
                               field_proxy_type   => field_real64_proxy_type
   #endif

   implicit none
   private

   public :: field_type, &
             field_proxy_type

   end module field_mod

The choice of compile def will point ``field_type`` fields to one of
two concrete implementations of the field object:
``field_real32_type`` or ``field_real64_type``. Similarly, there are
32-bit and 64-bit versions of the ``field_proxy_type``.

The choice made at build-time applies to all ``field_type`` variables.
Where an application requires a combination of 32-bit and 64-bit
fields an application can define additional field types that are
controlled by separate compile defs. The science code has to be
written such that code in one part of the application uses the
different field type definitions.

Different field type objects are made available by taking a copy of
the ``field_mod`` module, changing the name of the public types and
ensuring they are configured by a different compile def. With the
appropriate configuration of three individual compile defs, and
definitions of two additional field types, each of the fields declared
in the following code can be either 32-bit or 64-bit:

.. code-block fortran

   type(field_type)            :: wind_field
   type(r_tran_field_type)     :: dry_mass
   type(r_solver_field_type)   :: theta_advection_term

.. attention::

   The ``field_mod`` module also declares a ``field_pointer_type``
   which points to a field pointer of the chosen default precision.
   The ``field_pointer_type`` is used in ``select type`` operations
   within the infrastructure code for field collections as field
   collections can hold both fields and pointers to fields.

   Field collections support the ability to access an individual named
   field and also the ability to iterate over all the fields in the
   field collection.

Integer fields
==============

The infrastructure supports 32-bit integer fields:
``integer_field_type``. Their creation and usage is essentially the
same as for real fields. One key difference is that real fields and
integer fields have their own set of `PSyclone built-in operations
<https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dynamo0p3.html#built-in-operations-on-integer-valued-fields>`_.

Currently, there is no known requirement for 64-bit integer fields, so
a 64-bit integer field is not supported.

Column-first and layer-first fields
===================================

A function space definition affects the order of the data in a
field. By default, data in a field is ordered column-first - often
referred to as `k-first`. Optionally, a function space can be
constructed such that field data is ordered layer-first - often
referred to as `i-first`.

The data order of a field has to match with the data order expected by
a kernel.

.. _section multidata field:

Multidata fields
================

Multidata fields hold more than one quantity on the same mesh and
function space. The number and list of quantities is defined by the
application. Illustrative examples used in the Momentum\ :sup:`®`
atmosphere model are multidata fields that contain fields for several
different vegetation or surface types. But the Momentum\ :sup:`®`
model also uses multidata fields to store data at different soil
levels (rather than have a 3D mesh representing soil layers) and a
12-item multidata field to store monthly climatology data.

Multidata fields are created by first obtaining a multidata function
space.

.. code-block:: fortran

   integer, intent(in)                :: surface_tiles
   type(function_space_type), pointer :: fspace_surface_tiles
   type(field_type)                   :: canopy_water

   ! Get a reference to a lowest order W3 multidata function space
   fspace_surface_tiles =>
        function_space_collection%get_fs(mesh2D, 0, W3, surface_tiles)

   ! Create a field to hold wind data
   call canopy_water%initialise(fspace_surface_tiles, name = "canopy_water")

Multidata fields can be used when an array of fields needs to be
passed into a kernel. Within the kernel, data on each point in the
mesh is contiguous in memory.

To illustrate, the following kernel code loops over the field types
within the inner-most loop, where the kernel is called to operate on
single column of the mesh on a column-ordered field.

The ``map(dof)`` reference points to the data point for one of the
dofs of the cell at the first level of the 3D mesh. For each level
up, the code steps ``nfield_types`` points.

.. code-block:: fortran

   do levels = 0, nlayers-1
     do dof = 1, ndofs_per_cell
       do field_type = 0, nfield_types-1
          data(map(dof) + levels * nfield_types + field_type) = ...
       end do
     end do
   end do
