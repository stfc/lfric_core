Modeldb

Introduction
============

The modeldb class is a data structure that is designed to encapsulate all the data required to describe both the scientific and technical state of a model.

The modeldb class can hold:

* Model field data such as all the standard field collections (e.g. the depository, prognostics and diagnostics) along with all the other model specific field collections and field bundles.
* Other model data such as single values, arrays or objects
* Configuration that is read in from namelists
* Clock/calendar objects
* MPI communicator
* I/O information

There is a requirement that the LFRic code be able to run more than one instance of a "model" from the same executable. For example, you might want to run a linear model and its adjoint in the same executable. Or you might want to run a number of members of an ensemble simultaneously from the same executable. In order to make this possible, multiple versions of the model state can be stored in multiple copies of modeldb.

How to use
==========

The modeldb class contains a collection of field collections. Fields can be stored in field collections, then these field collections stored in modeldb.

Other values, such as single values, arrays or even objects can be stored in a collection of key-value pairs that is stored with modeldb

Items common to all models like clock and calendar and MPI information can be accessed directly from modeldb

Fields
~~~~~~

The modeldb object contains an item called ``fields``. This is just a collection (actually a linked list) of field collections. These field collections hold fields in the same way as any other field collection.

To put a new collection into "fields"
-------------------------------------

To add a collection to ``modeldb%fields`` use:

.. code-block:: fortran

  call modeldb%fields%add_empty_field_collection("my_collection", table_len = 100)

where ``"my_collection"`` is the name of the field collection you want adding and the ``table_len`` is the length of the hash table that is used to hold the fields in the collection. Small collections will be more efficient with a small ``table_len``, but collections with many fields will be more efficient with a larger ``table_len``.

To put a field into one of the collections
------------------------------------------
.. code-block:: fortran

  type( field_collection_type ), pointer :: my_collection
  type( field_type ),                    :: my_field
  
  my_collection => modeldb%fields%get_field_collection("my_collection")
  call my_collection%add_field(my_field)

This will put a copy of ``my_field`` into the collection. If you want to use the version held in the collection, you will need to retrieve a pointer to it from the collection.

To get a field out
------------------

Assuming the field, ``my_field``, has the name "my_field", use:

.. code-block:: fortran

  type( field_collection_type ), pointer :: my_collection
  type( field_type ),            pointer :: my_field
  
  my_collection => modeldb%fields%get_field_collection("my_collection")
  call my_collection%get_field("my_field", my_field)

This returns a pointer to the actual field held in the collection. Any changes to the field you have extracted will instantly change the version in modeldb. They both refer to the same location in memory.

Values
~~~~~~

The modeldb object contains an item called ``values``. This is a collection of key-value pairs. Many "values" can be stored in this collection and are accessed via their key (or name). The "values" that can be stored in a key-value pair must be one of:

* Scalar (or arrays of) 32-bit real value(s) (``real(real32) ::``)
* Scalar (or arrays of) 64-bit real value(s) (``real(real64) ::``)
* Scalar (or arrays of) 32-bit integer value(s) (``integer(int32) ::``)
* Scalar (or arrays of) 64-bit integer value(s) (``integer(int64) ::``)
* Scalar (or arrays of) logical value(s) (``logical ::``)
* A text string or an array of text strings (``character(*) ::``)
* Any Fortran object that inherits from ``abstract_value_type`` from the module ``key_value_mod`` (``type, extends(abstract_value_type) ::``)

(the definitions used here for the variable "kinds" are from the intrinsic module ``iso_fortran_env``)

The final item on the list ("any Fortran object") makes the collection of values very powerful. Anything from the object that encapsulates a time-stepping algorith to the object that stores all the atmosphere-ocean coupling information can be stored in modeldb.

To put a value in
-----------------
.. code-block:: fortran

  real(real64) :: my_value

  my_value = 7.0_real64
  call modeldb%values%add_key_value('my_value', my_value)

Again, this will put a copy of the value into the collection

To get a value out
------------------
.. code-block:: fortran

  real(real64), pointer :: my_value

  call modeldb%values%get_value("my_value", my_value)

This returns a pointer to the value held in the collection. Any subsequent maths performed on what is returned (the pointer) will change the value held in the collection. They both refer to the same location in memory.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a copy of the configuration that has been read in from namelists for the particular instance of the model. See the configuration documentation (TBA) for more details.

I/O contexts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An I/O context is used to describe how, when and where data are read from or written to disk. Different groups of data can be read/written in different circumstances, so there is a requirement to hold a number of I/O contexts. The modeldb object contains an item called ``io_contexts`` for this purpose. It is simply a collection of the different io_contexts that are required.

To put an I/O context into the collection
-----------------------------------------
.. code-block:: fortran

  type( lfric_xios_context_type )        :: my_io_context
  
  call modeldb%io_contexts%add_context(my_io_context)

This will put a copy of ``io_context`` into the collection. If you want to use the version held in the collection, you will need to retrieve a pointer to it from the collection.

To get an I/O context out of the collection
-------------------------------------------

Assuming the context, ``my_io_context``, has the name "my_io_context", use:

.. code-block:: fortran

  type( lfric_xios_context_type )        :: my_io_context
  
  call modeldb%io_contexts%get_io_context("my_io_context", my_io_context)

This returns a pointer to the actual I/O context held in the collection.
