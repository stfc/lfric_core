Mesh generation
=====================

LFRic fields require an association with a 3D-mesh object. Such a mesh object
requires formal definition of its entities (nodes,edges,faces,volumes) and how
they are interconnected. LFRic 3D-mesh objects are constructed internally by
the LFRic application via extrusion of 2D-meshes which are read in from file.

This section aims to describe supported 2D-meshes and how to generate them for
use in an LFRic application.
