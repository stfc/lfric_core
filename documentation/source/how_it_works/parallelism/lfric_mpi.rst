.. _lfric_mpi:

LFRic Message Passing Interface
===============================

All global MPI operations are wrapped in the lfric_mpi object. Processor to
processor (i.e. halo exchanges) are handled by ``halo_comms``. Most of the
functions in the `lfric_mpi` object are simple wrappers to MPI library
functions. They provide a way to encapsulate the MPI functionality and insulate
the rest of the code from changes to the external library.

For details of the API to the ``lfric_mpi`` wrappers, see 
:ref:`How to use: lfric_mpi <lfric_message_passing_interface>`

Different versions
------------------

The ``lfric_mpi`` wrapper provides three versions of the object that provide
different levels of functionality. These are selected through preprocessor
directives. The build system sets these directives based on how environment
variables are set.

No MPI
^^^^^^

If for some reason, it is not possible or not desirable to link to the system
MPI library, it is possible to preprocess the source so all calls to the system
MPI library are eliminated. Single processor serial running of the model is
still supported in this mode. This option is chosen by setting the preprocessor
directive ``NO_MPI``, which is set by the build system in response to the
environment variable ``NO_MPI``. The logic is negative, because the default (in
the absence of any environment variables or preprocessor directive) should be to
link to the MPI library.

MPI_F08/Legacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user selects to use the system MPI (i.e. does not set ``NO_MPI``), the
lfric MPI wrapper can use either of the two interfaces the system MPI library
provides. The original "legacy" interface stores many of its internals (such as
the handle used to identify communicators) as integers. This means that it is
impossible to implement effective type checking - one integer looks just like
any other to the compiler. A second interface has been implemented where each of
these integers is wrapped in its own object (e.g. the communicator is held in an
``mpi_comm`` object). This allows full type checking. This interface is called
"mpi_f08". The ``lfric_mpi`` wrapper object supports both interfaces.

Within the code, use of the legacy interface is selected by using the
proprocessor directive ``LEGACY_MPI``, Not using the preprocessor directive
will default to providing code that uses the mpi_f08 interface.

The current LFRic build system sets the ``LEGACY_MPI`` preprocessor directive in
response to querying the environment varable: ``USE_MPI_F08``.

* If the environment variable: ``USE_MPI_F08`` is set, the build system doesn't
  use the ``LEGACY_MPI`` preprocessor directive and the mpi_f08 interface is
  used.
* If the environment variable ``USE_MPI_F08`` is **not** set the ``LEGACY_MPI``
  preprocessor directive is used and the legacy MPI interface is used.

.. warning::
   The default behaviour when the preprocessor directive is not set is the
   **opposite** of default behaviour when the environment variable (within the
   build system) is not set. Eventually the mpi_f08 interface should be the
   default everwhere - so the preprocessor directives in the code were written
   to default to mpi_f08 - but until there is full support for mpi_f08, the way
   the environment variable is used in the build system means the legacy
   interface will be the default.

Moving between the different interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To insulate LFRic users from how the system library holds the communicator,
LFRic users should only pass around the LFRic construct that contains the
communicator: the ``lfric_comm_type`` object.

But even with this abstraction, the code has to interact with external libraries
that may still be using the legacy interface (such as XIOS, Yaxt etc.) For these
cases, the ``lfric_comm_type`` object can provide the legacy, integer version of
the communicator by calling the function:
``lfric_comm_type%get_comm_mpi_val()``.

When the Oasis coupler is used, the Oasis3-MCT library insists on initialising
MPI and returning the integer version of the communicator for LFRic to use. For
this reason, it is also possible to initialise the ``lfric_comm_type`` from the
integer version of the communicator by calling the subroutine:
``lfric_comm_type%set_comm_mpi_val(comm)``.
