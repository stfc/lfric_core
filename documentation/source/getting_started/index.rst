Getting Started
===============

For initial orientation, a :ref:`quick overview <repository_contents>`
of the main contents of the LFRic core repository is given. As noted, the
Momentum atmosphere model, and related applications, are developed in separate
repositories. The LFRic core repository does include some small LFRic
applications for training purposes or for developing and testing particular
technical capabilities.

It may be useful to look at the Glossary of Terms and the FAQs as you get
started to familiarise yourself with various terms used in LFRic. There are 
links to both the Glossary and FAQs on the start page and in the right-hand 
navigation bar on all other pages.
