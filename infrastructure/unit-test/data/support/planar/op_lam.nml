!--------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example namelists for mesh generation
!--------------------------------------------------------------------
! These example namelists will result in the mesh generators
! producing an output file (<mesh_filename>) which will
! contain <n_meshes> mesh topologies which are identified by
! the by <mesh_names>.
!
! Additional intergrid mappings may be produced and included
! in the output file. Each map is specified by an item in the
! <mesh_maps> list. Maps are specified by a string of the two
! mesh names spearated by a ":". Each item will cause a
! map to be added to the maps source mesh, i.e.
!
! 'dynamics:physics' will result in a map added to the
!
!  *  "dynamics" mesh (source) object mapping to "physics"  (target)
!  *  "physics"  mesh (source) object mapping to "dynamics" (target)
!
! Notes:
!  *  Only the first "n_meshes" listed in mesh_names will be
!     output in the mesh file.
!  *  All spherical co-ordinates are given the order
!     [longitude, latitude] in the units, degrees_east, degrees_north
!     respectively

! Planar Meshes: Only used by the planar mesh generator
!==================================================================
! Each planar mesh is specified by the corresponding number of
! cells on a panel edge in the x/y axes. These are listed in the
! variables <edge_cells_x>/<edge_cells_y> and correspond to the
! order of mesh topologies given by <mesh_names>.
!
! All lised meshes will occupy the same domain and periodicity.

! Note: When requesting a integrid mesh map, for a given pair of
!       of source/target meshes, one meshes edge cell value must
!       be a factor of the other.
