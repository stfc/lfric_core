description=Method to generate the perturbation.
!enumeration=true
help=This can be an analytical perturbation or random data.
    =The analytical perturbation is based on the DCMIP gravity wave test.
    =The random data is generated with the Fortran intrinsic function 'random_number'.

[namelist:validity_test]

description=Provides settings for the tangent linear validity tests.
help=The validity tests are performed using the integration test framework.

[namelist:validity_test=number_gamma_values]
compulsory=true
description=The number of values of gamma to loop through.
fail-if=this <0 ;
help=Gamma is the size of the perturbation used in the validity test.
    =For standard testing (i.e. through rose), the number of gamma values should be 2.
    =But to create a graph of the relative error against gamma, then a value around 10 should be used.

compulsory=true
description=The frequency to update the linearisation state.
fail-if=this <0 ;
help=In the integration tests, when running over multiple timesteps,
    = the linearisation state is produced by stepping the nonlinear model
    = and then copying this output to the linearisation state.
    = The update_frequency controls how often to copy the output to the
    = linearisation state, e.g. every 3 timesteps.
