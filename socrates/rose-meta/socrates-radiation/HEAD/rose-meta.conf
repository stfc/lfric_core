    =Homogeneous
    =  Horizontal water content variability is ignored.

    =  The mean water content in each gridbox is multiplied by given
    =  scaling factors.
    =_________________________________________________________________
    =MCICA
    =  A stochastic cloud generator is used to produce sub-columns
    =  containing different water content values, which are randomly sampled.
    =_________________________________________________________________
